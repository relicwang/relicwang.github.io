I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/science-engineering/departments-schools/cs/home.aspx">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">University of the Nottingham Ningbo China</a> (UNNC). 

I received my master’s degree in Computer Science from <i>Northwestern University</i> (US) and bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with minor in Mathematical Science at <i>Wenzhou-Kean University</i> (WKU). Prior to starting my PhD journal, I joined Wenzhou-Kean University (WKU) from 2019 to 2022 as a lecturer and then as an adjunct professor till 2023. I have been affiliated with the <i>Center on Innovation and Assistive Technology for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders</i> directed by Dr. Tiffany Y. Tang since 2015. 

My recent research focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI), affective computing, ubiquitous computing, and the applications of sensing and wearable technologies, with a particular emphasis on healthcare and special education.

<!-- Previously, I am honored to be cooperated with <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/">Prof. Anne Marie Piper</a> (UCI),  <a href="https://csmt.wku.edu.cn/en/node/1830">Prof. Tiffany Tang</a> (WKU), and <a href="https://csmt.wku.edu.cn/en/node/1829">Prof. Pinata Winoto</a> (WKU). -->

Our workshop on the topic of <i>Interactive Design with Autistic Children Using LLM and IoT for Personalized Training: The Good, The Bad and The Challenging</i> was accepted in <i>UbiComp 2024</i>. Visit our workshop site for more information: https://idwac.github.io/.

<!-- The courses I taught cover diverse levels including Fundamentals of Computer Science (Recognized as Zhejiang Provincial Level First-Class Course), Computer Organ. & Programming, Database Management Systems, Computer Systems, Intro. to Unix/Linux, and Python Programming.
I was awarded with one China national scholarship (the first student in WKU), three times university level first-class scholarship and extra-curricular scholarship. And numerous awards from Microsoft national and international level competitions. -->
